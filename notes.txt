0 freq = 30 khz
1 freq = 36 khz

bandwidth = 2khz, so separation between keys is at least double that

to avoid reflections, have a period of 45ms between pulses
^^ can possibly refine/lower this if needed

pulse length of 5ms

2kHz tone detector bandwidth is wide enough to mitigate Doppler shifts

words are separated by an even longer guard period (current implementation uses at least twice t_guard)

four parameters per packet:
-thrust: 4 states
-frequency: 4 states
-pitch: 7 states
-yaw: 7 states
-video recording: 2 states
4 * 4 * 7 * 7 * 2 = 1568 => 11 bits
10 bits expanded to 16 using (15, 11) hamming encoding with additional parity bit
